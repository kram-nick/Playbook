        That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice because exclusion is often the default in our industries 
        (both technology and consulting). It takes active effort to find the hidden biases in our companies and remove them. 
        One of our primary aims is to be "public by default". This playbook therefore contains nearly all of the 
        policies and practices that we use at Obvious. It represents many hours of research, lots of thoughtful debates, 
        and some serious introspection. 
        It’s certainly not perfect, but we think it’s a great place to start.`,
