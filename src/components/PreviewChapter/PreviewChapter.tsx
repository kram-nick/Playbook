            publishing them, other companies can benefit from our research and
            make their own policies more inclusive. All feedback and suggestions
            are appreciated. Weâ€™ve gotten several different perspectives to help
            arrive at these policies, but we are certainly missing many more and
            making mistakes as a result. This is a work in progress that we hope
            will get better with more time and more contributors. If these
            policies sound like a place where you want to work, please do look
            through our open career listings. The Obvious Employee Handbook is a
            derivative of the Tidepool Employee Handbook, which is itself
            derived from the Clef Employee Handbook. These are/were available to
            all via a Creative Commons license, and for that we are very
            thankful. We hope that many more people will suggest ways for us to
            improve these policies.
